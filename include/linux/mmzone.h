 * one of lrugen->lists[]. Otherwise it stores 0.
 *
 * A page is added to the youngest generation on faulting. The aging needs to
 * check the accessed bit at least twice before handing this page over to the
 * eviction. The first check takes care of the accessed bit set on the initial
 * fault; the second check makes sure this page hasn't been used since then.
 * This process, AKA second chance, requires a minimum of two generations,
 * hence MIN_NR_GENS. And to maintain ABI compatibility with the active/inactive
 * LRU, these two generations are considered active; the rest of generations, if
 * they exist, are considered inactive. See lru_gen_is_active(). PG_active is
 * always cleared while a page is on one of lrugen->lists[] so that the aging
 * needs not to worry about it. And it's set again when a page considered active
 * is isolated for non-reclaiming purposes, e.g., migration. See
 * lru_gen_add_page() and lru_gen_del_page().
 *
 * MAX_NR_GENS is set to 4 so that the multi-gen LRU can support twice of the
 * categories of the active/inactive LRU when keeping track of accesses through
 * page tables. It requires order_base_2(MAX_NR_GENS+1) bits in page->flags.

 * though page tables or read ahead. A page in any other tier (N>1) is marked
 * by PG_referenced and PG_workingset.
 *
 * In contrast to moving across generations which requires the LRU lock, moving
